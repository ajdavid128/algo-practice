# Problem 1:
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples
makeNegative(1);    // return -1
makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
makeNegative(0);    // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12

Notes
• The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
• Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

# Problem 2:
ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

Examples (Input --> Output)
"1234"   -->  true
"12345"  -->  false
"a234"   -->  false


# Problem 3:
Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).
