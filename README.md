# Problem 1:
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples
makeNegative(1);    // return -1
makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
makeNegative(0);    // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12

Notes
• The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
• Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

# Problem 2:
ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

Examples (Input --> Output)
"1234"   -->  true
"12345"  -->  false
"a234"   -->  false


# Problem 3:
Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).


# Problem 4:
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"


# Problem 5
Sentence Smash
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Example
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

# Problem 6 
Task:
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
Rules:
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

# Problem 7
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
Your function should only return a number, not the explanation about how you get that number.

# Problem 8
Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.

Use conditionals to return the proper message:

case =>	return
name equals owner => 'Hello boss'
otherwise => 'Hello guest'

# Problem 9
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example:

[1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24


# Problem 10
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321


# Problem 11
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

Example: (Input --> Output)

"Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
isIsogram "moose" = false
isIsogram "aba" = false

# Problem 12
In the game of Golf, each hole has a par, meaning, the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

Strokes	Return
1 === "Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2 === "Eagle"
par - 1 === "Birdie"
par === "Par"
par + 1 === "Bogey"
par + 2 === "Double Bogey"
>= par + 3 === "Go Home!"

par and strokes will always be numeric and positive. 

# Problem 13
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:

* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']

# Problem 14
In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

Example
alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )

# Problem 15
 Given a list of numbers, create a function that returns the first number divisible by 7 that appears.

Test Cases:
- [24, 50, 12, 7, 18, 14, 21, 82]
- [5, 48, 8, 20, 7, 22]
- [78, 3, 8, 33, 32, 90, 63]

# Problem 16
You're given two lists of n amount of numbers. All of those numbers are the exact same, except the second list has one additional number the other does not.

How do you identify the value of that second number?

For example:
[5, 65, 4, 8, 13, 27]
[5, 65, 4, 8, 12, 13, 27]

# Problem 17
FizzBuzz! Write a function that counts to 100 printing each number along the way. Every time the program comes across a number that is divisible by 3 print the string "Fizz" and every time it comes across a number that is divisible by 5 print the string "Buzz". In addition to printing the words separately, print the string "FizzBuzz" for every number divisble by both 3 and 5.

# Problem 18
Writre a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######

# Problem 19
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a # character. The characters should form a chessboard. Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
  # # # #
 # # # # 
  # # # #
 # # # # 
  # # # #
 # # # #
  # # # #
 # # # #

 When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable (const size = 8) and change the program so that is works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

# Problem 20
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

Count Change	Cards
    +1: 	    2, 3, 4, 5, 6
     0:	      7, 8, 9
    -1:	      10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'

You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Outputs: -3 Hold or 5 Bet

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
Do NOT return an array.
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.

# Problem 21
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.


# Problem 22
The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

# Problem 23
You are creating a function that aids in the maintenance of a musical album collection. The collection is organized as an object that contains multiple albums which are also objects. Each album is represented in the collection with a unique id as the property name. Within each album object, there are various properties describing information about the album. Not all albums have complete information.

The updateRecords function takes 4 arguments represented by the following function parameters:

records - an object containing several individual albums
id - a number representing a specific album in the records object
prop - a string representing the name of the album’s property to update
value - a string containing the information used to update the album’s property
Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

Your function must always return the entire records object.
If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.
If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, assign the value to that album's prop.
If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, add the value to the end of the album's tracks array. You need to create this array first if the album does not have a tracks property.
Note: A copy of the recordCollection object is used for the tests. You should not directly modify the recordCollection object.

# Problem 24
Count the number of Duplicates
Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

Example:
"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
"aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice

# Problem 25
Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

# Problem 26
In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples
highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
Notes
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.


# Problem 27
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

# Problem 28
If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!

Task:
Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...". Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.

# Problem 29
The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

# Problem 30
You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.

Examples
[7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
[5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]

# Problem 31
Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

# Problem 32
Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.

Give your answer as a string matching "odd" or "even".

If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).

Examples:
Input: [0]
Output: "even"

Input: [0, 1, 4]
Output: "odd"

Input: [0, -1, -5]
Output: "even"

# Problem 33
Our football team has finished the championship.

Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4

# Problem 34
Create a function that accepts an array and prints out the ratio of positive numbers, negative numbers and zeros within the array with exactly 6 decimal places.

Rules: numbers in array will be: -100 <= n <= 100
Print the following 3 lines, each to 6 decimals:

1. proportion of positive values
2. proportion of negative values
3. proportion of zeros

# Problem 35
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

Example
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
The minimum sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 and the maximum sum is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24. The function prints -> 16 24

# Problem 36
Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

Example
s = '12:01:00PM'
Return '12:01:00'.
s = '12:01:00AM'
Return '00:01:00'.

Function Description:
Complete the timeConversion function in the editor below. It should return a new string representing the input time in 24 hour format.

timeConversion has the following parameter(s):
string s: a time in 12 hour format

Returns:
string: the time in 24 hour format

Input Format:
A single string s that represents a time in 12-hour clock format (i.e.: hh:mm:ssAM or hh:mm:ssPM).

Constraints:
All input times are valid

Sample Input:
07:05:45PM
Sample Output:
19:05:45

# Problem 37
Find the median integer of an array of numbers. The array must be sorted so the integers are in order (either lowest to highest or viceversa). The array provided will always have an odd number of elements. 

# Problem 38
Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

Example
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]
The unique element is 4.

# Problem 39
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals in javascript.

For example, the square matrix arr  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9=15. The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9=17. Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.

Function description

Complete the diagonalDifference  function

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:
int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Return
int: the absolute diagonal difference
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr.
Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i] , and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j].

Constraints
-100 <= arr[i][j] <= 100

# Problem 40
Alternative Sorting
Another sorting method, the counting sort, does not require comparison. Instead, you create an integer array whose index range covers the entire range of values in your array to sort. Each time a value occurs in the original array, you increment the counter at that index. At the end, run through your counting array, printing the value of each non-zero valued index that number of times.

Example
arr = [1,1,3,2,1]

All of the values are in the range [0...3], so create an array of zeros, result = [0,0,0,0]. The results of each iteration follow:

i	arr[i]	result
0	1	[0, 1, 0, 0]
1	1	[0, 2, 0, 0]
2	3	[0, 2, 0, 1]
3	2	[0, 2, 1, 1]
4	1	[0, 3, 1, 1]
The frequency array is [0,3,1,1]. These values can be used to create the sorted array as well: sorted = [1,1,1,2,3] .

Note
For this exercise, always return a frequency array with 100 elements. The example above shows only the first 4 elements, the remainder being zeros.

Challenge
Given a list of integers, count and return the number of times each value appears as an array of integers.

Function Description

Complete the countingSort function in the editor below.

countingSort has the following parameter(s):

arr[n]: an array of integers
Returns

int[100]: a frequency array

# Problem 41
We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.

A lookUpProfile function that takes name and a property (prop) as arguments.

The function should check if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.

If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.

If name does not correspond to any contacts then return the string No such contact.

If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match name then return the string No such property.

const contacts = [
  {
    firstName: "Akira",
    lastName: "Laine",
    number: "0543236543",
    likes: ["Pizza", "Coding", "Brownie Points"],

# Problem 43
Create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Example
filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

# Problem 44
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

# Problem 45
The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

1.08 --> 30
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.

# Problem 46
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) // returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]

# Problem 47
Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

# Problem 48
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

Examples:(Input --> Output)

121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square

# Problem 49
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]


# Problem 50

Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

    Example:
    "camelCasing"  =>  "camel Casing"
    "identifier"   =>  "identifier"
    ""             =>  ""
